# solidity-pentest

1. Deploy the contract onto ropsten testnet

2. Use `truffle console --network ropsten`

3. Use `web3.eth.getStorageAt("0x79Bbc5f4d3970B529E74134084dB1326Df5De5f6", 0, x => console.log(x))` to query the storage/values.


# SaferMoney.sol
<pre>
//To avoid Re-entrancy in using call.value
  
  function withdraw() external{
         uint256 amount = balanceOf[msg.sender];
         balanceOf[msg.sender] = 0; // typical safeguard for re-entrancy
         (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");
         require(success, "Transfer failed.");
  }
  </pre>
  
  
  If msg.sender is a smart contract, it has an opportunity on line 19 to call withdraw() again before line 20 happens. 
  In that second call, balanceOf[msg.sender] is still the original amount, so it will be transferred again. 
  This can be repeated as many times as necessary to drain the smart contract.
